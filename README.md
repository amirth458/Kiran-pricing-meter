# Engineering Onboarding Guide

## Code Style

Some developers feel the need to debate code style. Other engineers will use the project's style and get stuff done. We prefer engineers who get stuff done. Consistency is important, please follow these guidelines.

We use the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) in our code. This is the style used by npm, GitHub, Zeit, MongoDB, Express, Electron, and many others. Be sure to use an automatic formatter like [standard-formatter](https://atom.io/packages/standard-formatter) for Atom and [vscode-standardjs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/chenxsan.vscode-standardjs) for Visual Studio Code.

Line length should be limited to 80 characters.

## Code Principles

* Code should be as simple, explicit, and as easy to understand as possible.
* Functional style is preferred to OOP. When possible functions should be pure and not rely on shared state or side effects.
* Avoid large frameworks; use small modules that are easy to understand.
* Modules must use this order so that they can be understood quickly when skimmed:
  1. External dependencies: anything listed in `package.json`, e.g. `require('http')`
  2. Internal dependencies: any files created in the project itself, e.g. `require('./api')`
  3. Constants and other setup: this includes anything *absolutely necessary* to be defined before `module.exports`
  4. Exports: `module.exports` should be as close to the beginning of the file as possible. The module should export either a single function or a "catalog object", e.g. `module.exports = { method1, method2, ... }`
  5. Functions: these go after the above sections. Use function hoisting to control the placement of your functions so that important, high-level functions are above smaller more-general utility functions.
* Use descriptive variable names. Function names should be a verb like `route()` or verb combined with a noun like `routeRequest()`.
* Keep your functions short. If your function is over 40 lines, you should have a good reason.
* Functions should not accept more than 3 arguments. Use a single options object if you need more arguments.
* Keep nesting to a minimum. Use [early returns](https://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early), single-line conditionals, and function calls.

## Git

Version control is a project's best source of documentation when done correctly. When trying to understand code it's extremely useful to use `git blame` to find both the PR and the issue associated with that change.

PRs should be small and focused. Each commit should solve a single problem and be covered by a test that exemplifies that particular feature or fix.

All PRs must be reviewed by a teammate before they are eligle to be merged into  the `master` branch. Large PRs are difficult to review. Be sure to break large PRs into smaller ones so that they can be reviewed quickly and deployed to production.

* Never commit passwords, access tokens, or other credentials into version control. If you think you absolutely have to, ask first. If you do this by accident, tell someone immediately.
* Each commit should be as small and as simple as possible.
* The project must be operational and have all tests passing after every commit.
* Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
  * See the "Commit Types" section below
  * Valid types are `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, and `test:`
* Do not mix feature changes (added functionality) with fixes (restored functionality), refactors (no change in functionality), or style changes (only whitespace or other cosmetic changes).
* The exception to the above single commit rule is when a PR introduces new packages. Create one extra commit in the same PR for each new package your PR needs.
* Do not modify a project's `.gitignore` to add files related to your editor or environment. Use your own [global .gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335420/global-git-ignore/22885996#22885996) for that instead.


## Commit Types

Commit types (e.g. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`) are important because they are a signal to the reviewer for what they should be looking for and how much scrutiny the review needs.

**Feature** commits require the most scrutiny. They add or change functionality, require additional tests, and have the greatest chance of introducing a bug.

**Fix** commits are smaller and have a more bounded scope than feature commits. Features usually introduce multiple new behaviors, but fix commits will only modify a single behavior. Fix commits need to provide additional test coverage because the existing tests were insufficient to catch the error. Feature commits should have multiple tests for these behaviors, but fix commits typically introduce a single test to prove that the error has been fixed (test should fail without the fix inactive and pass with it active). These commits can introduce additional bugs, but it’s less common than feature commits.

**Refactors** need less scrutiny than feature or fix commits because little about the app changes. All consumers of the refactored part of the app should be 100% unaware of the change. If module A is refactored, and module B depends on A, module B does not need to be tested because A hasn’t changed anything from their perspective. Similarly, anything that depends on B doesn’t need to be tested either, no change should bubble up to cause issues. Since nothing is changing, any existing tests/QA should already be sufficient to catch any issues created by the refactor. Refactors don’t generate additional tests.

**Style** commits need the least amount of scrutiny. They tend to be very repetive (converting from snake_case to camelCase, standardizing indentation, or changing newlines). These changes will have no functional impact on the code and any existing tests should be sufficient.

Reference from [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines):

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
